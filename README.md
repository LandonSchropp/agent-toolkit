# Agent Toolkit

This repository contains my personal toolkit for working with AI agents such as Claude Code and
Codex CLI. It's primarily composed of skills, which are implemented following the [Agent
Skills](https://agentskills.io/) specification. It also contains reusable documentation which is
intended to be referenced in `AGENTS.md` files.

The toolkit is customized to my personal workflow, and isn't meant to be used by anyone else,
although others are welcome to use it if they'd like.

## Installation

### Claude Code

To use this toolkit with Claude Code, simply install it as a plugin.

TODO: Add instructions for installing as a plugin.

## Environment

The server requires three environment variables that contain paths to markdown files. These aren't
included in this repository because they outline my unique writing style.

- `WRITING_FORMAT`: Formatting conventions.
- `WRITING_VOICE`: Language and voice guidelines—how the writing should sound.
- `WRITING_IMPROVEMENT`: Coaching and improvement suggestions.

In addition, you'll need to provide a `PLANS_DIRECTORY` variable containing the relative path of a
directory to store plan files in.

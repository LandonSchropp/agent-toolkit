# Agent Toolkit

This repository contains my personal toolkit for working with AI agents such as Claude Code and
Codex CLI. It's primarily composed of skills, which are implemented following the [Agent
Skills](https://agentskills.io/) specification. It also contains reusable documentation which is
intended to be referenced in `AGENTS.md` files.

The toolkit is customized to my personal workflow, and isn't meant to be used by anyone else,
although others are welcome to use it if they'd like.

## Installation

### Claude Code

To use this toolkit with Claude Code, simply install it as a plugin.

TODO: Add instructions for installing as a plugin.

## Environment

Environment variables that may be referenced:

- `WRITING_FORMAT`: Markdown formatting conventions (not included in this repository as it outlines my unique writing style).
- `PLANS_DIRECTORY`: Relative path to a directory for storing plan files.

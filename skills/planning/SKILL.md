# Planning

## Workflow

1. If the scope of the plan is not clear from the arguments or previous context, ask the user: "Please describe the plan or provide a Linear issue ID, Linear issue URL, or Sentry issue URL (for bug-fix)." If the user responds with a Linear issue, fetch its details using the Linear MCP server. If the user provides a Sentry issue URL (bug-fix only), store it for use in the plan template.

2. Determine the feature branch. If the user has provided a Linear issue, the branch specified in the issue will be the feature branch. If the current branch is the default branch (main/master), ask the user: "What feature branch would you like to use?" Otherwise, ask the user: "Would you like to use `{current_branch}` as the feature branch?"

3. If the current branch is the feature branch, move on to step 4. Otherwise, ask the user: "Would you like to use `{current_branch}` as the base branch?" Then call `scripts/create-feature-branch` with the feature branch and the base branch.

4. Create a plan file using `scripts/generate-plan-template.ts`. This will generate a pre-populated plan for you to fill out. Read the resulting file.

5. Fill out each section of the plan one at a time. Follow the instructions in the template for each section.
   - If this is a new branch with no existing work, remove the Context section entirely. If resuming work on an existing branch, summarize what has already been done by running `git log` and `git diff` to see commits and changes.
   - For the Scope and Plan sections, research the plan and its implementation. Ask the user clarifying questions if needed to understand the task and what's required to implement it.
   - Do not modify sections that contain the comment "Copy this section exactly as written, without modification", but do delete the comment.

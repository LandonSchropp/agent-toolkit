description: Create a git commit with an appropriate message
---

Create a git commit by analyzing the staged changes and generating a succinct commit message.

1. Invoke the `git-commit` skill.
2. Run `git status` to see what changes are staged for commit. If there are no staged changes, stage all of the files.
3. Analyze the changes and draft a commit message.
4. Create the commit.
